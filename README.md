# Fit Plane In 3D
This short repo shows by example 3 different methods to fit a plane to 3D points. In general, the best way to fit a plane to 3D points is to first remove the centroid from the point coordinates and then either use the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the points (method 1) or the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the points (method 2). Both methods yield similar results.
